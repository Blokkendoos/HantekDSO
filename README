HantekDSO is a USB-oscilloscope software for
Hantek/Voltcraft/Darkwire/Protek/Acetech/e.t.c
DSO-2090/2150/2250/5200A/e.t.c. oscilloscopes.

It based on libusb and QT/OpenGL libraries. Project includes a firmware
extraction utility and udev rules file for loading firmware under Linux/Unix.

DSO software depends on: 
- libusb (library to enable user space application programs to communicate with USB devices)
- Qt3 (cross-platform application and UI framework)
- mesa-libGL (open-source implementation of the OpenGL specification)
To successfully build a project you need to have all development packages installed
(libusb-devel, qt-devel (version 3.X), mesa-libGL-devel).

Firmware extraction utility depends on:
- libbfd (mechanism for the portable manipulation of object files in a variety of formats)
- libiberty (collection of subroutines used by various GNU programs)
Both libraries (libbfd and libiberty) included in binutils-devel package.

Also you need to have fxload utility installed in order to be able to upload firmware
in to the oscilloscope.


How to BUILD:
./configure
make
make install


How to INSTALL:

Firmware

You need to find the firmware for the oscilloscope (usually in the folder
/Driver on CD), convert it to .hex files, and make sure they get loaded
into the oscilloscope when it is connected.
Locate one of the following files, depending on the model of 
your scope: DSO20901.SYS, DSO21001.SYS, DSO21501.SYS, DSO22501.SYS, 
DSO520A1.SYS and put it in the folder with dsoextractfw utility.
Run the program dsoextractfw. It searches for the files listed above
in the current directory. If it finds any of them, it creates 
two files named "DSOxxxx_firmware.hex" and "DSOxxxx_loader.hex". Move 
these files to /usr/share/HantekDSO/ . Copy the file HantekDSO.rules to 
/etc/udev/rules.d/ .

Now, the firmware should be loaded automatically when the DSO is connected 
to an USB port. Once the firmware is loaded, the LED on the DSO starts to 
flash red. You can now run the program hantekdso. The LED will blink green.
Make sure you have sufficient privilegies on the USB device or run as root
(probably not recommended in the long run).
