How to INSTALL:

Firmware

You need to find the firmware for the oscilloscope (usually in the folder
/Driver on CD), convert it to .hex files, and make sure they get loaded
into the oscilloscope when it is connected.
Locate one of the following files, depending on the model of 
your scope: DSO20901.SYS, DSO21001.SYS, DSO21501.SYS, DSO22501.SYS, 
DSO520A1.SYS and put it in the folder with dsoextractfw utility.
All characters in the file name MUST be uppercase. Please, rename the file
to uppercase letters if need. Run the program dsoextractfw. It searches
for the files listed above in the current directory. If it finds any of
them, it creates two files named "DSOxxxx_firmware.hex" and "DSOxxxx_loader.hex".
Move these files to /usr/share/HantekDSO/ .
Copy the file HantekDSO.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ .

Now, the firmware should be loaded automatically when the DSO is connected 
to an USB port. Once the firmware is loaded, the LED on the DSO starts to 
flash red. You can now run the program hantekdso. The LED will blink green.
Make sure you have sufficient privilegies on the USB device or run as root
(probably not recommended in the long run).
